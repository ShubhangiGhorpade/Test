1.public static void main(String agrs[])
    public is a AccessSpecifier which can be accessed within and outside the package.
	static is a non access specifier which has a single copy storage and bounded to compile time.
	void is a return type which does not return anything 
	main is a method which is the entry point for execution
	String arg[] is a command line where during compliation it can read data form compandprompt.
	
2.class:It is a blueprint or template through which object can be created.
  object:It is a real world entity which has states and behaviours.

3.JVM:Java Virtual Machine 
      physically doesnot exists
      which is mainly used to load,verify and execute
      which provides the runtime environment.

  JRE:Java Runtime Environment
      which is physically exists
      provides the runtime
      it has set of library+jvm

  JDK:Java Development Kit
      which is physically exists
      It is mainly used for development
      it has development tools+Jre

2.INPUT:1234
  OUTPUT:4321	  
  
  public static void main(String[] args){
  int num=1234;
  int rev=0;
  for(int i=0;i<num;i++){
  num=num%10;
  rev=rev*10+num;
  num=num/10; 
  }
 }
 
3.Input:program
  OUTPUT:margorp
  
  String str="program";
  String rev="";
  for(int i<str.length()-1,i>0,i--){
  char ch[]=str.toCharAt(i);
  rev=rev+ch[i];
  }
  
4.Constructor:It is a special whose name is same as the class name.
              It doesnot have any return type
              It provides a default constructor which is provided by the compiler
          Types:1.Default constructor:which is provided by the compiler.
                2.Parameterized constructor:which is user defined with some arguments .

5.this keyword:it is used in current instances
               it is used to differeniate between instance and local variable.
  this method:it is used for constructor chaining.
               chaining in the same class .

6.Main method is static between we dont need to create the object of class before the class loads the static members are executed.and it is bounded to compile time.
           Types of Method are:
		   static Method:Those which uses static has a keyword.
		                 We dont need to create the instance to access.

		   Non-static method:Those which dont uses static has a keyword.
		                 We need to create the instance to access.
			   
7.int num=100;
for(int i=1;i<num;i++){
if(num/5 && num/10){
sop(num);
}
}

8.Java class loader is where it loads all the class,members in the memory area.

9.We cannot have private constructor bcoz constructor are used for chaining and intializing instance variable.
  yes,we can over load constructor by calling one constructor into another constructor.
 EX:method in object class that is wait.

10.int arr[]={12,3,2,45,6,7,6}
sop(arr.length);

11.No,bcoz static is bounded to compile time.
